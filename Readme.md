# IT System log analyzer

## Problem Statement

1408 - IT System log analyzer

## Organization

Ministry of Home Affairs

## Category

Software

## Domain Bucket

Blockchain & Cybersecurity

## Objective

This website aims to address the need for a centralized system to analyze IT system logs across different locations of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). Currently, there is no central platform for experts to assess threats and security breaches systematically. The proposed solution is to develop a centralized system for analyzing the IT systems deployed at various CRPF locations across the country.
